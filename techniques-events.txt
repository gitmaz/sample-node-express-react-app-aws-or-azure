To demonstrate the use of events in your MVC web app, let's consider an example where you want to emit events when a new user is created and allow other parts of your application to listen for and respond to these events. In this case, we'll use the built-in EventEmitter module in Node.js.

Create an Event Emitter:
First, you need to create an event emitter instance to emit and handle events. You can create this emitter in a new file, let's call it eventEmitter.js:

javascript

// eventEmitter.js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const userEvents = new EventEmitter();

module.exports = userEvents;
Emit Events When a New User is Created:
Modify your userController.js to emit an event when a new user is created. For example:

javascript

// controllers/userController.js
const userModel = require('../models/userModel');
const userEvents = require('../eventEmitter'); // Import the event emitter

const createUser = (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;

  const newUser = userModel.createUser(username, password);
  if (!newUser) {
    return res.status(409).json({ error: 'User already exists' });
  }

  // Emit a 'userCreated' event when a new user is created
  userEvents.emit('userCreated', newUser);

  res.status(201).json({ message: 'User created' });
};

module.exports = {
  createUser,
};
Listen for the Event in Another Part of Your App:
You can have other parts of your application, like a notification system or logging system, listen for the 'userCreated' event and respond to it. Here's an example:

javascript

// Some other part of your application, e.g., notificationService.js
const userEvents = require('../eventEmitter'); // Import the event emitter

userEvents.on('userCreated', (newUser) => {
  console.log(`New user created: ${newUser.username}`);
  // You can perform actions like sending a notification or logging here
});
With this setup, when a new user is created using the /users route, the 'userCreated' event will be emitted, and any other part of your application that is listening for this event can respond accordingly. This allows for decoupled and modular communication within your MVC web app using events.
