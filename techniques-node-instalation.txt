To install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), you can follow these steps. The process may vary slightly based on your operating system. I'll provide instructions for common operating systems:

For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
bash
Copy code
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Node.js and npm
sudo apt install nodejs npm

# Verify installation
node -v
npm -v
For macOS:
bash
Copy code
# Install Homebrew if not installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

# Install Node.js and npm
brew install node

# Verify installation
node -v
npm -v
For Windows:
Using Node.js Installer:

Download the Node.js installer from the official website: Node.js Downloads
Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
Using Chocolatey (if you have Chocolatey installed):

bash
Copy code
# Install Node.js and npm
choco install nodejs

# Verify installation
node -v
npm -v
After installation, you should be able to use node -v and npm -v to verify that Node.js and npm are installed.

If you encounter any issues during the installation, refer to the official Node.js documentation for troubleshooting: Node.js Installation

User
I am using amazon linux

On Amazon Linux, you can use the following commands to install Node.js and npm:

bash
Copy code
# Install Node.js 14.x (LTS version) using NodeSource repository
sudo yum install -y gcc-c++ make
curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo bash -
sudo yum install -y nodejs

# Verify installation
node -v
npm -v
These commands install Node.js version 14.x, which is the current LTS (Long Term Support) version. You can adjust the version number in the curl command if you want a different version.

After running these commands, you should be able to use node -v and npm -v to verify that Node.js and npm are installed.
