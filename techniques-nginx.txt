how can I configure nginx to use /public/index.php when a url path is like http://elastic-beanstak--app-domain/api/someaction (for any request with url section immediately after domain name being /api/ ) ?

To configure Nginx to use /public/index.php for URLs with a path starting with /api/, you'll need to define a location block in your Nginx configuration. Here's an example configuration:

nginx
Copy code
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _; #accomo-env.eba-7h3qb4f3.ap-southeast-2.elasticbeanstalk.com;

    root /var/www/html/public;
    index index.php;

    location /api/ {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /public/index.php$is_args$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
                include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php-fpm/www.sock;
                fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
                include fastcgi_params;
    }
     # Additional server configuration...

        #listen        80 default_server;
        access_log    /var/log/nginx/access.log main;

        client_header_timeout 60;
        client_body_timeout   60;
        keepalive_timeout     60;
        gzip                  off;
        gzip_comp_level       4;
        gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript application/x-javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;

        # Include the Elastic Beanstalk generated locations
        include conf.d/elasticbeanstalk/*.conf;



    # Additional server configuration...
}

Explanation:

location /api/ Block:

This block handles requests with a URL path starting with /api/.
The try_files directive checks if the requested file exists. If not, it rewrites the request to /public/index.php.
location ~ \.php$ Block:

This block handles PHP files.
It includes the necessary configuration for handling PHP scripts using FastCGI.
Adjust the fastcgi_pass directive based on the PHP version you are using.
Additional Configuration:

Adjust the server_name directive to match your actual domain.
Set the root directive to the path where your application is located.
After making these changes, remember to restart Nginx for the configuration to take effect:

bash
Copy code
sudo service nginx restart
This configuration assumes that your PHP-FPM socket file is located at /var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock. Update it according to your PHP version.

Make sure to test your configuration and adapt it based on the specifics of your application structure and requirements.
