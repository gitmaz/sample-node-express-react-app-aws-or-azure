/* Flexbox */
When working with Flexbox, you can style the child items (flex items) within a flex container using various properties. Here are some common properties you might use:

Flex Container (Parent) Properties:

display: flex;: This property is applied to the parent container to enable Flexbox.
flex-direction: Defines the main axis of the flex container. It can be row, row-reverse, column, or column-reverse.
justify-content: Aligns items along the main axis. Values include flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, and space-around.
align-items: Aligns items along the cross axis. Values include flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, and stretch.
Flex Item (Child) Properties:

flex: A shorthand property for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. Example: flex: 1 1 auto;.
align-self: Overrides the align-items value for a specific flex item. Values are the same as align-items.
order: Controls the order of the flex items. By default, all items have an order of 0.
Here's a simple example:

css
Copy code
/* Flex Container (Parent) Styles */
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* or column, depending on your layout */
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

/* Flex Item (Child) Styles */
.flex-item {
  flex: 1; /* This item will grow and shrink equally */
  max-width: 300px; /* Example: Set a maximum width for the flex item */
  align-self: flex-start; /* Override alignment for this item */
  order: 2; /* Change the order of this item */
}
In this example, .flex-container is the parent, and .flex-item is a child. Adjust these styles based on your specific layout requirements. You can also use these properties within a media query for responsive designs.

Remember to replace the class names (flex-container and flex-item) with the actual class names you are using in your HTML.
