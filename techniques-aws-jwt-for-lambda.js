Elastic Beanstalk Application and Environment:

CDK constructs for Elastic Beanstalk to define the application and environment. You can use the awseb.ElasticBeanstalkApplication and awseb.CfnEnvironment constructs.
Custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI):

If you're using a custom AMI, you would define an EC2 instance with the specified AMI ID. You can use the ec2.Instance construct.
Amazon RDS (Optional):

If your Lucee application requires a database, you might define an Amazon RDS database using the rds.DatabaseInstance construct.
Amazon S3 (Optional):

If your application needs to store or retrieve files, you might use Amazon S3. You can define an S3 bucket using the s3.Bucket construct.
Amazon VPC and Subnets (Optional):

Define a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnets if your application requires custom networking configurations. The ec2.Vpc and ec2.Subnet constructs can be used.
Amazon Route 53 (Optional):

If you have a custom domain, you might define a Route 53 hosted zone and DNS records. You can use the route53.HostedZone and route53.RecordSet constructs.
Here's a high-level example using CDK in TypeScript:

typescript
Copy code
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as eb from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-elasticbeanstalk';
import * as ec2 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import * as rds from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-rds';

class LuceeStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Create VPC
    const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'LuceeVPC', {
      // Define VPC properties
    });

    // Create Elastic Beanstalk Application
    const luceeApp = new eb.ElasticBeanstalkApplication(this, 'LuceeApp', {
      applicationName: 'LuceeApplication',
    });

    // Create Elastic Beanstalk Environment
    const luceeEnv = new eb.CfnEnvironment(this, 'LuceeEnv', {
      applicationName: luceeApp.applicationName,
      environmentName: 'LuceeEnvironment',
      // Define Elastic Beanstalk environment properties
    });

    // Create RDS Database (Optional)
    const rdsDatabase = new rds.DatabaseInstance(this, 'LuceeDatabase', {
      engine: rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.MYSQL, // or another supported engine
      // Define RDS properties
    });

    // Add other constructs as needed

    // Output the environment URL
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'EnvironmentURL', {
      value: luceeEnv.attrEndpointUrl,
      description: 'Lucee Elastic Beanstalk Environment URL',
    });
  }
}

const app = new cdk.App();
new LuceeStack(app, 'LuceeStack');
This is a basic example, and you'll need to customize it based on your specific requirements and application architecture. Also, consider using the CDK libraries that match your preferred programming language (e.g., Python, Java).
